        We are building a word processor and we would like to implement a "reflow" functionality that also applies full justification to the text.
        Given an array containing lines of text and a new maximum width, re-flow the text to fit the new width. Each line should have the exact specified width.
        If any line is too short, insert '-' (as stand-ins for spaces) between words as equally as possible until it fits.
        Note: we are using '-' instead of spaces between words to make testing and visual verification of the results easier.


    lines = [ "The day began as still as the",
          "night abruptly lighted with",
          "brilliant flame" ]

        reflowAndJustify(lines, 24) ... "reflow lines and justify to length 24" =>

        [ "The--day--began-as-still",
          "as--the--night--abruptly",
          "lighted--with--brilliant",
          "flame" ] // <--- a single word on a line is not padded with spaces
     */

}
