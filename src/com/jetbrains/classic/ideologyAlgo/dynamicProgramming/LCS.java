    /*
        Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

        A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted
        without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
        A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

        If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

        Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
