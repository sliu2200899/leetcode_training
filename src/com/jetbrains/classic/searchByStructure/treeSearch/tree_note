code pattern:


classic problems:
    preorder traversal
    inorder traversal
    postorder traversal
    level order traversal
    vertical order traversal
    morris traversal

    path sum
        1, 2   ->  recursion
        3  -> double recursion

    maximum path sum
    LCA
        1, 2 -> DC
        3 ->

    serialize binary tree
    construct binary tree









key note in the explanation:
    explain what is different traversal
    use which data structure
    how to use that to solve the problem during the process


    recursion in tree traversal:
