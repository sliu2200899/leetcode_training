code pattern:


classic problems:
    preorder traversal
    inorder traversal
    postorder traversal
    level order traversal
    vertical order traversal
    morris traversal

    path sum






key note in the explanation:
    explain what is different traversal
    use which data structure
    how to use that to solve the problem during the process


    recursion in tree traversal:
