code pattern
    no duplicates, and find some specific value
    find the first target element in the array
    find the last target element in the array
    find the first element that is large or equal to the specific element
    find the last element that is less or equal to the specific element


classic problems
    search insert position
    search value in rotated sorted array
    find minimum value in rotated sorted array
    find peak element
    sqrt
    pow
    median of two sorted array
    koko eat bananas


key point in the explanation
    1. regardless of the rotation rules, at least 1 potion is still sorted
    2. get rid of half of the unqualified elements per iteration
    3. find the sorted potion and do a range check
