prefix sum has one disadvantage:
    disabled when some node is changed

Fenwick tree was proposed to solve the prefix sum problem
the idea is to store partial sum in each node and get total sum by traversing the tree from leaf to root. The tree has a height of log(n)

Query: O(log(n))
Update: O(log(n))
