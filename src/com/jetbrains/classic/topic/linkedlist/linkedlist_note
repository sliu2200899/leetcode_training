explanation:
        we need a dummy node, and we need to find a right position to place the node 4 into the sorted part.
        dummy -> null | 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> null
          |             |     |
        prev           cur   next
        because we are dealing with linked list, it is not an array, we cannot access a position using index.
        therefore, to find a place to insert a node, we need to use a pointer prev to traverse the sorted part from the beginning.

        so we can insert the node 4 right behind the dummy node,
        But before inserting the node 4, we need to unlink it with unsorted part.
        so we may use a pointer next to hold the rest of the unsorted part.
        and then, we can finish the insertion, which is like this.
